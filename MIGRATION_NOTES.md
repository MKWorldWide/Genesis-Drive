# Migration Notes

This document outlines the significant changes made during the repository rehabilitation process.

## 🚀 Major Changes

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Improvements
- **Node.js Version**: Standardized on Node.js 20.x LTS
- **Job Structure**: Split into separate jobs for linting, testing, and building
- **Caching**: Added npm cache for faster builds
- **Concurrency Control**: Added to prevent multiple runs for the same commit
- **Python Testing**: Improved test coverage and reporting

### 2. Documentation
- **README.md**: Completely restructured with better organization
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Added comprehensive contribution guidelines
- **DIAGNOSIS.md**: Created to document the initial state and planned improvements

### 3. Development Experience
- **.gitignore**: Significantly expanded to cover more development environments and tools
- **EditorConfig**: Added for consistent coding styles across editors
- **Dependency Management**: Using `npm ci` for reliable dependency installation

### 4. Security
- **Dependencies**: Updated to latest secure versions
- **Secrets**: Added .env files to .gitignore
- **CI/CD Security**: Limited permissions in GitHub Actions

## 🔄 Migration Steps

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify Environment**
   - Node.js 20.x is now required
   - Python 3.11+ is needed for AthenaMyst_Host

3. **CI/CD**
   - The new CI pipeline will automatically run on pull requests and pushes to main
   - Test coverage reports are now available as build artifacts

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **Node.js Version**
   - Minimum Node.js version is now 16.0.0
   - Recommended Node.js version is 20.x LTS

2. **Dependencies**
   - All dependencies have been updated to their latest stable versions
   - Some deprecated APIs may need to be updated in the codebase

## 📈 Performance Improvements

- Faster CI builds due to caching
- Parallel test execution
- Reduced build times with optimized dependency installation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Ensure you're using Node.js 20.x
   - Run `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in CI environments

2. **Test Failures**
   - Check the test output in the CI logs
   - Run tests locally with `npm test`

## 📅 Future Work

- [ ] Add end-to-end testing
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking
- [ ] Improve test coverage
